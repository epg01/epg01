# Hi, I'm Emmanuel Palacio Gaviria. 👋

##  👨🏻‍💻  About me

I am a person who likes to work in a team a lot, I love to learn new things every day, I am very passionate about everything related to operating systems and low-level.

I love all programming languages, although I do not know most of them, but the ones that I have studied so far have seemed to me: challenging, wonderful and beautiful.

The languages that have happened to me the most and the ones that I would stay with for the rest of my life are C, python and machine language. 😍🥰🧡

I hope some day understand the kernel 🧠
